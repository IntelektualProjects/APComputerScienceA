# APComputerScienceA

# Hello! I'm IntellektualProjects, an aspiring engineer, compulsive programmer, and avid reader of Sci-Fi!

# These Programs here were all completed in AP Computer Science A at my school, but I uploaded them to Github for more organization and reference for future coding projects. These were all completed at various times during the year of 2021, or COVID-19 as we all remember it :)

#Programming material is split by chapter and order assigned at school.
